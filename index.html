		<h3>Who we are</h3>
		<hr class="rule"/>
	<p>First Ballymena Presbyterian Church is a warm hearted, progressive evangelical church, situated in the centre of the town of Ballymena. There has been a Presbyterian witness here since 1627. We aim to be a warm and welcoming Christian community, growing in grace and growing in our love for Jesus Christ as we study and listen to his word. We seek to serve him and live for him in our community. First Ballymena is part of the Presbytery of Ballymena which belongs to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.</p>
	<!--What do we do-->
	<h3>What we do</h3>
	<hr class="rule"/>
	<p>We are a family of Christian believers who seek to have a passion for God and a compassion for people.

As depicted by our logo we are a people who are putting our hand in the hand of the one who is able to do all things and who is Lord of the church. With his guiding hand we fear no evil and we are constantly stepping out in faith in our journey with him.

In First Ballymena we aim to make the God of the Word and the Word of God relevant to how people are living their lives today. This is done in a variety of ways from regular times of worship to more informal seeker friendly family services; from small interactive bible study groups to large youth orientated events. We have just recently introduced Alpha as a means of introducing people to Jesus Christ and to faith. For more information on this click here.

We are thankful to God that he continues to answer prayer as we see people of all ages becoming Christians and starting to become vibrant fruit bearing disciples of Jesus. We are committed in our aim to make this a welcoming Christian Fellowship and looking at different ways in which we can help those who have recently joined us to become more integrated into our fellowship.</p>
<!--Where we want to be-->
<h3 id="we">Where we want to be </h3>
<hr class="rule" />
<p>It is our vision to see our church re-vitalisedas God continues to work with us and we long to see our church become more of a family of God's people where we are growing both numerically and spiritually.

A warm welcome is assured to all who would join us for worship.</p>
<p>First Ballymena is an historic congregation situated in the centre of our busy and expanding town. It was here that the first Presbyterian cause in the area was established - but while the congregation traces its roots back to 1627, we seek to bear witness to Christ in ways that are relevant to the modern world. Our goal is expressed in a congregational mission statement which affirms that:

"First Ballymena has a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people." 
 

This is our aim, not only at Sunday worship, but also in a wide range of programmes which seek to cater for all age groups within a congregation of 500 families. Our historic building is often included in local tours organised by the borough council and visitors often come from USA and Australia to see where their ancestors worshipped.</p>
